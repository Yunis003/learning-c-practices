# C Language Practice (Learning)

This repository contains all my practice code for learning the C programming language. It includes a variety of exercises, algorithms, and projects that I have worked on during my learning journey.

## Contents

- **Basic Syntax:** Simple programs to understand C syntax, data types, and operators.
- **Control Structures:** Programs demonstrating `if-else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- **Functions:** Implementation of functions, recursion, and various function types.
- **Data Structures:** Programs implementing arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting and searching algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, etc.
- **Pointers and Memory Management:** Understanding pointer operations, dynamic memory allocation, and pointers with arrays and structures.
- **File Handling:** Programs that demonstrate reading from and writing to files.

## Learning Progress

- **Completed:** Basic syntax, control structures, functions, and simple algorithms.
- **Ongoing:** Advanced data structures, algorithms, and memory management practices.
